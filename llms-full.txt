Glovo, a €2.5B quick-commerce unicorn, identified an opportunity to expand beyond B2C delivery into B2B SaaS by empowering grocery retailers to launch their own e-commerce platforms with Glovo's proven on-time delivery infrastructure.

#### Challenge

**The Core Problem:**
Tasked with launching a brand-new B2B SaaS platform from scratch to empower grocery retailers with e-commerce capabilities. The biggest challenge was defining the MVP scope—balancing an ambitious vision against tight delivery timelines while ensuring the platform would be something retailers would actually use and pay for.

### Case Study 2: Dott Digital Wallet for eCommerce Retention

**Timeline:** Q3 2020 – Q2 2021 (9-month initiative)

**Background:**
Dott's Portuguese eCommerce marketplace (Worten-CTT joint venture) had successfully scaled customer acquisition but faced a common eCommerce challenge: low repeat purchase rates limiting customer lifetime value.

#### Challenge

**The Core Problem:**
E-commerce marketplace demonstrated strong customer acquisition through marketing campaigns, but struggled with repeat purchases. Building purchase habits and implementing effective loyalty mechanisms were limiting customer lifetime value and overall business growth.

**Specific Challenges:**
1. **Low Repeat Purchase Rate:** Most customers made 1-2 purchases then churned
2. **No Retention Mechanism:** Lacked tools to bring customers back
3. **Checkout Friction:** Payment complexity deterring conversions
4. **Limited Customer Data:** Insufficient understanding of purchase patterns
5. **Complexity Constraint:** Solution couldn't add friction to shopping experience

**Business Context:**
- High customer acquisition costs
- Pressure to improve unit economics
- Need to demonstrate loyalty capabilities to parent companies (Worten/CTT)
- Competitive pressure from pure-play eCommerce platforms

#### Approach

**Strategic Insight - "Use It or Lose It" Psychology:**
Delivered a digital wallet feature with a strategic twist: added incentives structured to make shoppers repurchase or lose their cashback from previous purchases. This created a compelling reason to return beyond just product need.

   - Defined expiration rules optimizing both factors
   - Created tiered system rewarding loyalty

**Testing & Validation:**
- A/B tested different incentive structures
- Piloted with customer segments
- Iterated based on early behavioral data
- Refined expiration timings and amounts

**Technical Integration:**
- Integrated 3 new payment methods to reduce friction:
  - Apple Pay (for iOS users)
  - Google Pay (for Android users)
  - Alternative payment gateway (for broader reach)
- Seamless wallet balance application at checkout
- Smart prompts highlighting wallet value

#### Solution

**Digital Wallet Features:**

1. **Tiered Cashback System:**
   - Customers earned cashback based on purchase amount
   - Higher spend = higher percentage cashback
   - Cashback credited immediately to wallet
   - Visible balance in user account

2. **Expiration Mechanism ("Use It or Lose It"):**
   - Cashback had defined validity period
   - Clear communication of expiration dates
   - Push notifications before expiration
   - Created urgency to repurchase

3. **Segmented Tiers:**
   - Bronze: 2% cashback on purchases
   - Silver: 3% cashback on purchases
   - Gold: 5% cashback on purchases
   - Tier based on total historical spend

4. **Seamless Integration:**
   - One-click wallet application at checkout
   - Auto-select wallet for payment when balance available
   - Clear display of savings at every step
   - Combined with new payment methods

**User Experience Flow:**
1. Customer completes purchase
2. Earns cashback to wallet (instant gratification)
3. Sees balance in account (visual reminder)
4. Receives notification when expiration approaching (urgency)
5. Returns to use wallet balance (repeat purchase triggered)
6. Earns more cashback (flywheel effect)

#### Impact

**Retention Metrics:**

## Product Philosophy & Approach

### Core Principles

**1. Customer-Centricity with Business Pragmatism**
Balance deep customer empathy with business viability. The best products solve real customer problems while driving business value. Neither can be sacrificed for the other.

**2. Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven**
Use data to inform decisions, but don't let it override judgment and intuition. Data tells you what's happening, but you need to understand why and what to do about it.

**3. Speed Balanced with Quality**
Move fast without breaking things. Build quality in from the start—it's faster than fixing later. But avoid perfectionism that delays learning and iteration.

**4. Simplicity Over Feature Bloat**
The best solution is often the simplest one that solves the problem. Resist the temptation to add features just because you can. Every feature has a cost in complexity and maintenance.

**5. Outcome-Focused Execution**
Focus on outcomes (business results, customer value) not outputs (features shipped). Celebrate impact, not just delivery.

### Decision-Making Framework

**The Ruthless Prioritization Model:**
When evaluating features or initiatives, apply three lenses:
1. **Customer Value:** Does this solve a real, painful problem for customers?
2. **Business Impact:** Will this move our key metrics meaningfully?
3. **Technical Feasibility:** Can we build this reliably with our resources and timeline?

All three must be "yes" for something to make the roadmap. If only two are yes, put it in the backlog. If only one is yes, discard it.

**The 70% Rule:**
Ship when you're 70% confident, not 90%. The last 20% of certainty takes 80% of the time. Better to ship, learn, iterate than to perfect in isolation.

**The Reversible vs. Irreversible Decision Framework:**
- Reversible decisions (most decisions): Make them quickly, delegate them, bias toward action
- Irreversible decisions (architecture, pricing model, market positioning): Take more time, gather more data, involve more stakeholders

### Product Development Approach

**Discovery Phase:**
- Start with customer research, not solutions
- Map the problem space before the solution space
- Identify must-have vs. nice-to-have early
- Validate assumptions through prototypes and user testing
- Build business case with realistic projections

**Build Phase:**
- Define clear success metrics before building
- Ship MVPs iteratively, not in one big bang
- Instrument everything for learning
- Build quality and testing in from day one
- Document as you go, not after shipping

**Launch Phase:**
- Soft launch to learn before full rollout
- Have rollback plans for critical features
- Monitor obsessively in first 48 hours
- Capture qualitative and quantitative feedback
- Iterate quickly based on learnings

**Scale Phase:**
- Identify bottlenecks early through metrics
- Invest in technical foundations for scale
- Optimize for efficiency without sacrificing quality
- Build self-service where possible
- Automate repetitive processes

### Collaboration Style

### Potential Concerns & Responses

**Concern: "Based in Portugal, but role is US-focused"**
**Response:** I've successfully managed teams and stakeholders across US time zones. I'm available for US East Coast hours (my afternoons/evenings) and have made West Coast hours work when needed. For the right role, I'm open to relocation or extensive US travel.

**Concern: "Most experience at relatively smaller companies"**
**Response:** While Glovo and Dott were growth-stage startups, I worked at Nestlé (Fortune 500, CHF 93B revenue) managing global platforms across 40+ markets. I understand enterprise complexity and have managed vendor teams of 40+ engineers. My startup experience brings speed and adaptability.

**Concern: "Promoted quickly at Glovo - was there time to prove impact?"**
**Response:** The promotion came after delivering measurable results: 19% order growth, 40% faster integrations, successful 0-to-1 MVP launch in 6 months. The promotion recognized execution, not potential. I then served as Head of Product for 18+ months, continuing to drive growth and expansion.

**Concern: "Technical background - can you do strategic product work?"**
**Response:** My technical background is a strength, not a limitation. At Glovo and Dott, I defined product strategy, aligned stakeholders, and drove business outcomes. Technical depth enables better strategic decisions, not just tactical execution. I've presented to executives, boards, and investors successfully.

**Concern: "Limited US market experience"**
**Response:** While based in Europe, I've worked for global companies serving US markets (Nestlé, Rocket Internet ventures). I understand US SaaS business models, competitive dynamics, and customer expectations. I'm seeking US opportunities specifically to deepen this experience.

### Compensation Expectations

**Philosophy:**
Compensation should reflect experience level, role scope, company stage, and market rates. I'm looking for competitive packages aligned with Head of Product / Director of Product benchmarks in US SaaS companies.

**Components:**
- Base salary aligned with role and location
- Equity grant reflecting upside opportunity
- Performance-based bonus tied to product outcomes
- Benefits package (health, retirement, etc.)

**Flexibility:**
- More flexible on cash compensation at earlier-stage companies with strong equity upside
- Value meaningful equity stakes where product success directly impacts valuation
- Open to discussing compensation packages holistically
- Specific ranges available in direct conversations based on role details

### Interview Process Expectations

**What I Bring:**
- Detailed portfolio of product work and case studies

- References from engineering leaders, stakeholders, and team members

**What I Look For:**
- Clarity on product vision and strategy

4. Team interviews (product, engineering, design)
5. Executive/founder interview
